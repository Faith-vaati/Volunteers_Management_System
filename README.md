# Volunteer Management System
Organize and manage volunteer opportunities with ease.

Welcome to the Volunteer Management System! ðŸŒŸ This project is designed to simplify the process of managing volunteers and their activities, making it easier for organizations to connect with and coordinate their volunteers.
ðŸŒŸ The Inspiration

The inspiration for this project came from experiences of volunteering and working with non-profit organizations. It was cumbersome and inefficient how volunteer management could be. The goal was to create a system that would streamline the process, making it as intuitive and efficient as possible.

## Live Demo

### Books/Resources

- "Flask Web Development" by Miguel Grinberg
- "React - The Complete Guide" by Maximilian SchwarzmÃ¼ller

### Technology Trade-offs

- **Backend Framework:** Flask vs. Django  
  *Decision:* Flask was chosen for its simplicity and flexibility, allowing for faster development and customization.

- **Frontend Framework:** React.js vs. Vue.js  
  *Decision:* React.js was chosen for its popularity, robust ecosystem, and the team's proficiency with JavaScript.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/volunteer-management-system.git
   cd volunteer-management-system
   ```

2. **Backend Setup:**
   - Navigate to the `backend` directory:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     ```
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Set up environment variables and database configuration.
   - Run migrations:
     ```bash
     flask db upgrade
     ```

3. **Frontend Setup:**
   - Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     ```
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

## Usage

1. **Run the backend server:**
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

2. **Run the frontend development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Access the application:**
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
